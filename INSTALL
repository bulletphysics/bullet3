Bullet Collision Detection and Physics Library

** Windows Compilation **

Under Windows, projectfiles for Visual Studio version 6,7,7.1 and 8 are 
available in msvc/<version>.  For example, for Visual Studio 2005, open 
msvc/8/wksbullet.sln

The ColladaDemo and ConvexDecomposition demo needs to be able to locate the 
data files (jenga.dae and file.obj) in the current directory. Make sure Visual 
Studio points to the right folder (..\..).

Alternatively use CMake to autogenerate a build system for Windows:
	
	- Download/install CMake from www.cmake.org or package manager
	- List available build systems by running 'cmake' in the Bullet root folder
	- Create a build system using the -G option for example:
	
	cmake . -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" or
	cmake . -G "Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64"
		 

** Linux Compilation **

  - Download/install CMake from www.cmake.org or package manager
    CMake is like autoconf in that it will create build scripts which are then 
    used for the actual compilation

  - There are some options for cmake builds:
      BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: default 'OFF', set to 'ON' to build .so libraries
      BUILD_EXTRAS: default 'ON', compiles additional libraries in 'Extras'
      BUILD_DEMOS: default 'ON', compiles applications found in 'Demos'
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: default '/usr/local', the installation path.
      CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH: if you install outside a standard ld search path,
        then you should set this to the installation lib path.
      CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: default 'Release', can include debug symbols with
        either 'Debug' or 'RelWithDebInfo'.
    Other options may be discovered by 'cmake --help-variable-list' and
    'cmake --help-variable OPTION'

  - Run 'cmake' with desired options of the form -DOPTION=VALUE
    By default this will create the usual Makefile build system, but CMake can 
    also produce Eclipse or KDevelop project files.  See 'cmake --help' to see 
    what "generators" are available in your environment, selected via '-G'.
        For example:
        cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo

  - Assuming using the default Makefile output from cmake, run 'make' to 
    build, and then 'make install' if you wish to install.


** Mac OS X Compilation **

  - Download/install CMake from www.cmake.org or package manager
    CMake is like autoconf in that it will create build scripts which are then 
    used for the actual compilation

  - There are some options for cmake builds:
      BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: default 'OFF', set to 'ON' to build .dylib libraries
      BUILD_EXTRAS: default 'ON', compiles additional libraries in 'Extras'
      BUILD_DEMOS: default 'ON', compiles applications found in 'Demos'
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: default '/usr/local', the installation path.
      CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR: if you install outside a standard ld search 
        path, then you should set this to the installation lib/framework path. 
      CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES: defaults to the native architecture, but can be
        set to a semicolon separated list for fat binaries, e.g. ppc;i386;x86_64
      CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: default 'Release', can include debug symbols with
        either 'Debug' or 'RelWithDebInfo'.

    To build framework bundles:
      FRAMEWORK: default 'OFF', also requires 'BUILD_SHARED_LIBS' set ON
        If both FRAMEWORK and BUILD_SHARED_LIBS are set, will create
        OS X style Framework Bundles which can be placed in 
        linked via the -framework gcc argument or drag into Xcode projects.
    (If not framework, then UNIX style 'include' and 'lib' will be produced)
      
    Other options may be discovered by 'cmake --help-variable-list' and
    'cmake --help-variable OPTION'

  - Run 'cmake' with desired options of the form -DOPTION=VALUE
    By default this will create the usual Makefile build system, but CMake can 
    also produce Eclipse or KDevelop project files.  See 'cmake --help' to see 
    what "generators" are available in your environment, selected via '-G'.
        For example:
        cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DFRAMEWORK=ON \
              -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Library/Frameworks \
              -DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR=/Library/Frameworks \
              -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES='ppc;i386;x86_64' \
              -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo

  - Assuming using the default Makefile output from cmake, run 'make' to build 
    and then 'make install'.


** Alternative Mac OS X and Linux via 'jam' or autoconf/make **
  - at the command line:
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
  - 'jam' or 'make' depending on preference
  - If jam is not available for your system, you can compile it, jam sources 
    are included with the Bullet sources in jam-2.5
      - compiling jam:
        cd jam-2.5
        make
        sudo make install
