Bullet Continuous Collision Detection and Physics Library
Erwin Coumans

2006 August 10
	Added per-triangle material (friction/restitution) support for non-convex meshes. See ConcaveDemo for usage.

2006 August 9
	Added CMake support (see http://cmake.org)
	This can autogenerate makefiles, projectfiles cross platform (including MacOS X Xcode )
	Just run cmake . in the root folder and it will autogenerate build files
	
2006 July 26 Erwin Coumans
	Upgraded to COLLADA-DOM 1.4.1, latest SVN version
	ColladaDemo can export snapshots to .dae
	
2006 July 24 Erwin Coumans
	Added Compound CollisionShape support
	(this is still low performance -> requires stackless tree-versus-tree traversal for better performance)

2006 July 15 Erwin Coumans
	Added initial support for Parallel execution (collision detection, constraint solving)
	See ParallelPhysicsEnvironment in Extras\PhysicsInterface\CcdPhysics
	
2006 July 10 Erwin Coumans
	Added MacOS X support (some build issues mainly)
		
2006 July 5 Erwin Coumans
	Improved COLLADA 1.4 physics import, both COLLADA-DOM and FCollada

2006 June 29 Erwin Coumans
	Refactoring of the broadphase
	Moved some optional files to Extras: Algebraic ccd and EPA, quickstep
	Moved the limits on bodies/overlap to 32k and 65k
	
2006 June 25 Erwin Coumans
	Added basic Collision Filtering, during broadphase
	Allow adding meshes to the TriangleIndexVertexArray,
	(input for TriangleMeshShape) 
	Preparation for CompoundShape

2006 June 19 Erwin Coumans
	Added support for COLLADA Physics Import.
	Both jam and Visual Studio can compile ColladaDemo

2006 June 18 Dirk Gregorius <dirk@dirkgregorius.de>
	Started implementing Generic6DOF joint and setup basic interface


2006 June 17 Frank Richter <resqu@gmx.ch>
	Bumped version in configure.ac to 1.5.6 (assuming that "1.5f" is
	  the next version released).
	Updated files in mk/autoconf and mk/jam with copies from CS; fixes a 
	  GLU detection issue on MinGW.
	Set msvc/bullet_ico.ico as the default application icon.
	Disabled exceptions for gcc builds.
	Applied a patch from Michael D. Adams to fix a warning with gcc.
2006 jUNE 16 Erwin Coumans
	Constraints now merge simulation islands.

2006 May 24
	Improved GJK accuracy, fixed GjkConvexCast issue, thanks to ~MyXa~ for reporting
	
2006 May 19
	Added restitution support
	Moved out Friction and Dynamics info from ManifoldPoint (removed logical dependency)
	Added a void* m_userPersistentData in ManifoldPoint.
	Added a ContactDestroyedCallback, to allow user to handle destruction of m_userPersistentData

2006 May 13
	Fixed some bugs in friction / jacobian calculations. Reported by Dirk Gregorius. Thanks!

2006 May 9
	Fixed raycasting filtering
	Moved repository to SVN at https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/bullet
		
2006 April 27
	Moved raycasting to CollisionWorld, to make it more generic
	Added basic CCD option in the CcdCollisionDemo
	Fixed 'noResponse' mode, for triggering rigidbodies (useful for Artificial Intelligence queries)
	Improved Bullet/ODE sample (in Extras)
		
2006 April 10
	Separating Axis Test (SAT) convex hull collision detector, contribution by Simon Hobbs
	Added SIMD SSE Math classes (for above SAT)
	Added Mouse picking in CcdPhysicsDemo
	Improved penetration depth estimation in MinkowskiPenetrationDepthSolver, both accuracy and performance
	Added Hinge constraint
	Added quickprof profiling (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/quickprof )
		
2006 March 21 Frank Richter <resqu@gmx.ch>
	Removed VC manifest files.
	Removed superfluous "grpplugins" projects.

2006 March 20 Erwin Coumans
	Clamped the acculumated impulse rather then intermediate impulse (within the iteration)
	Use the persistent contacts for reusing the impulse
	Separated friction and normal solving for better stability
	Decreased the default number of iterations of the constraint solver from 10 to 4

2006 March 19 Frank Richter <resqu@gmx.ch>
	Removed a couple of CSisms from the VC projects.
	Fixed VC include & lib paths to go to the Addtional* options
	  instead the command line arguments.
	Added pkgconfig support.

2006 March 14 Frank Richter <resqu@gmx.ch>
	Added support for shipped GLUT on MinGW.
	Fixed GLUT support on MinGW.

2006 March 13 Frank Richter <resqu@gmx.ch>
	Bolted on Jam-based build system.
	Generated VC project files.
	Fixed GCC warnings.
	Fixed Linux build issues.

2006 March 13
Added 3D Sweep and Prune Broadphase Collision Detection, Contribution from Simon Hobbs.

2006 March 2
	Minor change in license to ZLib/LibPNG
	This makes it legally a bit easier to deploy on Playstation 3
	Prepared for more generic constraints, added ConstraintsDemo

2006 Feb 23
	Rearranged files and dependencies to allow for easier standalone Collision Detection without Bullet Dynamics.
	See Demos/CollisionInterfaceDemo and Extras/ode/ode/test/test_BulletGjk.cpp for examples how to use.


... todo: add history

2003 Initial version (continuous collision detection)
