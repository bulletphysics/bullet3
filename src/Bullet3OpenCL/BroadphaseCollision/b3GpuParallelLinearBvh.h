///@brief GPU Parallel Linearized Bounding Volume Heirarchy(LBVH) that is reconstructed every frame
///@remarks
///See presentation in docs/b3GpuParallelLinearBvh.pdf for algorithm details.
///@par
///Related papers: \n
///"Fast BVH Construction on GPUs" [Lauterbach et al. 2009] \n
///"Maximizing Parallelism in the Construction of BVHs, Octrees, and k-d trees" [Karras 2012] \n
///@par
///The basic algorithm for building the BVH as presented in [Lauterbach et al. 2009] consists of 4 stages:
/// - [fully parallel] Assign morton codes for each AABB using its center (after quantizing the AABB centers into a virtual grid)
/// - [fully parallel] Sort morton codes
/// - [somewhat parallel] Build binary radix tree (assign parent/child pointers for internal nodes of the BVH)
/// - [somewhat parallel] Set internal node AABBs
///@par
///[Karras 2012] improves on the algorithm by introducing fully parallel methods for the last 2 stages.
///The BVH implementation here shares many concepts with [Karras 2012], but a different method is used for constructing the tree.
///Instead of searching for the child nodes of each internal node, we search for the parent node of each node.
///Additionally, a non-atomic traversal that starts from the leaf nodes and moves towards the root node is used to set the AABBs.
