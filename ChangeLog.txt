Bullet Continuous Collision Detection and Physics Library
Primary author and maintainer: Erwin Coumans

2007 Aug 2
	- added compound and concave-convex (swapped) case for BulletMultiThreaded collision detection, thanks to Marten Svanfeldt
	- refactored broadphase and overlapping pair cache. This allows performance improvement by combining multiple broadphases. This helps add/remove of large batches of objects and large worlds. See also Pierre Terdiman forum topic:
	http://www.continuousphysics.com/Bullet/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1329


2007 July 27
	- added Ragdoll Demo
		Thanks to Marten Svanfeld (Starbreeze Studios)

	- added Vector Math library for SIMD 3D graphics linear algebra (vector, matrix, quaternion)
		See Bullet/Extras/vectormathlibrary
		Supports SIMD SSE, PowerPC PPU and Cell SPU (including PS3 Linux and CellBlade), as well as generic portable scalar version
		Will be used to improve BulletMultiThreaded performance
		Open Sourced by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. under the new BSD license
	- added SIMD math library
		4-way SIMD for common math functions like atan2f4, cosf4, floorf4, fabsf4, rsqrtf4 etc. Used by Vector Math library under PPU and SPU.
		Supports PowerPC (PPU) and Cell SPU, including PS3 Linux and CellBlade.
		See Bullet/Extras/simdmathlibrary
		Open sourced by Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. under the new BSD license

	
2007 July 25
	- added several patches: per-rigidbody sleeping threshold. added Assert to prevent deletion of rigidbody while constraints are still pointing at it
		Thanks to Marten Svanfeldt (Starbreeze Studios)
	
2007 July 13
	- fixed relative #include paths again. We can't use "../" relative paths: some compilers choke on it (it causes extreme long paths)
		Within the libraries, we always need to start with "BulletCollision/" or "BulletDynamics/ or "LinearMath/"

2007 July 10
	- Updated Bullet User Manual

2007 July 5
	- added btConeTwistConstraint, especially useful for ragdolls. See Demos/RagdollDemo
		Thanks to Marten Svanfeldt (Starbreeze Studios)

2007 June 29
	- btHeightfieldTerrainShape: Added heightfield support, with customizations
	- Upgraded to GIMPACT 0.2, see Extras/GIMPACT and MovingConcaveDemo
	- Several patches from Marten Svanfeldt (Starbreeze Studios)
		Improved collision filtering (in broadphase and rigidbody)
		Improved debug rendering
		Allow to set collision filter group/mask in addRigidBody
		
		
2007 June 15
	- Changed btAlignedObjectArray to call copy constructor/replacement new for duplication, rather then assignment operator (operator=).

2007 June 11
	- Added multi-threading. Originally for Playstation 3 Cell SPU, but the same code can run using Win32 Threads using fake DMA transfers (memcpy)
		Libspe2 support for Cell Blade / PS3 Linux is upcoming
		See Extras/BulletMultiThreaded. Usage: replace btCollisionDispatcher by btSpuGatheringCollisionDispatcher

	- Added managed Bullet library, entirely rewritten in C# for Windows and XBox 360 XNA
		See Extras/BulletX
		Thanks to KleMiX, aka Vsevolod Klementjev

2007 May 31
	- sign-bit went wrong in case of 32-bit broadphase, causing quantization problems. 
		Thanks DevO for reporting.

2007 May 23
	- Fixed quantization problem for planar triangle meshes in btOptimizedBvh
		Thanks Phil Knight for reporting and helping to fix this bug.
		
2007 May 20
	- btAxisSweep3: Fixed a bug in btAxisSweep3 (sweep and prune) related to object removal. Only showed up when at least one btStaticPlaneShape was inserted.
		Thanks tbp for more details on reproducing case.
	- btAxisSweep3: Fixed issue with full 32bit precision btAxisSweep3 (define BP_USE_FIXEDPOINT_INT_32), it used only 0xffff/65536 for quantization instead of full integer space (0xffffffff)
	- btRaycastVehicle: Added 'getForwardVector' and getCurrentSpeedKmHour utility functions
	- Fixed local scaling issues (btConvexTriangleMeshShape, btBvhTriangleMeshShape, removed scaling from btMatrix3x3). 
		Thanks Volker for reporting!
	- Added second filename search, so that starting BspDemo and ConvexDecompositionDemo from within Visual Studio (without setting the starting path) still works

2007 April 22
	- Added braking functionality to btRaycastVehicle
	- Removed tons of warnings, under MSVC 2005 compilation in -W4
	
2007 March 21
	- Fixed issues: comma at end of enum causes errors for some compilers
	- Fixed initialization bug in LocalRayResult (	m_localShapeInfo(localShapeInfo) )
	
2007 March 20
	- Added refit tree to quantized stackless tree, and updated ConcaveDemo as example.
	
2007 March 17
	- Added constraint solver optimizations, avoiding cross products during iterations, and gather rigidbody/constraint info in contiguous memory (btSolverBody/btSolverConstraint)
	- These optimizations don't give large benefit yet, but it has good potential. Turned on by default. Can be switched off using solver->setSolverMode(SOLVER_RANDMIZE_ORDER).
	- Enabled anti-jitter for rigid bodies. This is experimental, and can be switched off by setting a global (it is experimental so no proper interface) gJitterVelocityDampingFactor = 1.0;
	- Fixed bug in islandmanifold.heapSort(btPersistentManifoldSortPredicate()); , thanks Noehrgel for reporting this (affected Sun Solaris)
	
2007 March 12
	- Added compile-time toggle between on 16-bit and 32-bit fixed-point SAP broadphase. 
		This allows the number of bodies to exceed 32767
	- Enable useQuantizedAabbCompression on btTriangleMesh, see ColladaDemo
	
2007 March 8
	- Fixed bug in constraint/island sorting (caused by replacing STL by dedicated btAlignedObjectArray with heapSort)
		Thanks Clemens Unterkofler for pointing this out!

2007 March 6
	- removed STL from the Bullet library: replace std::vector by btAlignedObjectArray. Also removed the std::set for overlapping pair set, and turned it into an overlapping pair array. The SAP only adds objects, never removed. Removal is postponed for during traversal of overlapping pairs (duplicates and non-overlapping pairs are removed during that traversal).
	- added heap sort and binary search/linear search to btAlignedObjectArray
	- fixed wrong cast, thanks Hamstray, http://www.continuousphysics.com/Bullet/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1015


2007 Feb 25
	- Improved performance of convex collision shapes, cache local AABB instead of recomputation. This fixes issue with very slow performance in larger .bsp levels
	
2007 Feb 24
	- Added compressed/quantized AABB tree, 16 bytes per node, while supporting 32-bit (triangle) indices. 
	  Should be faster and smaller then original version (quantized aabb check is done in integer space)
		Original aabb tree nodes are still supported. They are 44 bytes, with full floating point precision and additional subPart index.
	- added meter-unit scaling support in ColladaConverter.cpp

2007 Feb 21
	- Build system: updated bullet.pc.in library names
	- Updated EPA comparison integration (missing parameter)
	
2007 Jan 04
	- fixed optimized AABB tree building: in some cases the tree building fails due to unbalanced trees, which generated stack overflow
	
2006 Dec 15
	- added contribution to allow double precision collision detection/dynamics. Define BT_USE_DOUBLE_PRECISION in your project and libraries that include Bullet

2006 Dec 14
	- merged contact and non-contact constraint solving into one loop, will improve stability of jointed bodies during collisions
	- added first draft for hingeConstraint motor
	
2006 Dec 8, Erwin Coumans
	- preparation for SIMD: added btAlignedAllocator and btAlignedObjectArray, to replace stl std::vector, same interface, but compatible with 16 byte alignment
	- cleaned up dependencies in autogenerated msvc projectfiles
	- aligned btVector3 on 16 bytes boundary, under win32. see if developers will come up with problems

2006 Dec 04, Erwin Coumans
	Added btNearCallback. This is similar to Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) dNearCallback, but important differences:
	- contact points are persistent (lifetime more then one frame, for warmstarting/incremental contact point management)
	- continuous collision detection, time of impact
	Added btRigidBody::isInWorld(), returns true if btRigidBody is inside a btCollisionWorld/btDynamicsWorld derived class
	Added angularFactor to btRigidbody, this helps some character control (no angular impulse applied)

	Added safety check into GJK, and an assert for AABB's that are very large
	Fixed kinematic support (deriving velocities for animated objects)
	Updated comparison/optional quickstep solver in Extras
	UserCollisionAlgorithm demonstrates btTriangleMesh usage (easier trimesh compared to index array version)

	Fixed minor leak in btOptimizeBVH
	Cleanup of btRigidBody construction
	added getW() in btQuaternion
	assert when setLinearVelocity is called on btRigidBody

	Added 2 headerfiles in src: btBulletCollisionCommon.h and btBulletDynamicsCommon.h

2006 Sept 23
	Fixed 2 bugs, causing crashes when removing objects. Should do better unit-testing. UnionFind and 3D SAP were involved.
